Abstract :â€” 

(Part A) This project involves exploration of wind 
speed data collected over several decades from the historical weather 
records. With the dataset being derived from Met Eireann's 'Dublin 
Airport' station, valuable insights can be gained by examining the 
patterns, trends, and fluctuations in wind speed. To effectively 
investigate these aspects, a combination of statistical and time series 
analysis techniques will be utilized, with special attention given to the 
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling 
approach. 

(Part B) This project delves into the analysis and estimation of 
potential heart conditions in people using a comprehensive dataset 
that includes factors such as age, weight, gender, and fitness level. 
Utilizing advanced logistic regression techniques, the research 
employs a range of approaches, including traditional logistic 
regression, regularized methods (Lasso and Ridge), and 
dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA). By conducting extensive exploratory data analysis, 
preprocessing, and model assessment, the project strives to provide 
valuable insights on the strengths and drawbacks of each model's 
predictive abilities.
